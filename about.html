			<p>
				My name is Charalambos Rossides but most people call me Harry.<br>
				I graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School
				at the National Technical University of Athens (<a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">ECE-NTUA</a>) in 2014.
				I then received the MSc degree in Systems and Control from the
				University of Twente (<a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/systems-control/">SC-UT</a>), The Netherlands, in 2016. In the meantime
				I worked at <a href="https://www.demcon.nl/en/">DEMCON</a> advanced
				mechatronics, Enschede, The Netherlands,
				supporting the development of medical devices. Currently being a PhD
				candidate at the bio-engineering group, Faculty of Engineering and
				Physical sciences, University of Southampton, UK, I am developing
				biomedical imaging and analysis tools for the study of early stages
				of colorectal cancer.
				My academic interests include (biomedical) signal processing and analysis,
				X-ray micro-computed tomographic imaging, computer engineering, systems and control theory.
