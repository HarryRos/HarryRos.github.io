			<p>
				<br>
				My name is Charalambos Rossides but most people call me Harry.<br><br>
				I graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School
				at the National Technical University of Athens (<a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">ECE-NTUA</a>) in 2014.
				I then received the MSc degree in Systems and Control from the
				University of Twente (<a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/systems-control/">SC-UT</a>), The Netherlands, in 2016. In the meantime
				I worked at <a href="https://www.demcon.nl/en/">DEMCON</a> advanced
				mechatronics, Enschede, The Netherlands,
				supporting the development of medical devices.<br><br>
				Currently being a <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/postgraduate/research_students/cr1v16.page?">PhD
				candidate</a> at the bio-engineering group, Faculty of Engineering and
				Physical sciences, University of Southampton, UK, I am developing
				biomedical imaging and analysis tools for the study of early stages
				of colorectal cancer.
				My academic interests include (biomedical) <strong>signal processing</strong> and analysis,
				X-ray micro-computed tomographic <strong>imaging</strong>, computer engineering, <strong>systems and control</strong> theory.
