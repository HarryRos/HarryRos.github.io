			<h1>Academic vitae</h1>
			<p>
				<br>
				My name is Charalambos Rossides but most people call me Harry.<br><br>
				I graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School
				at the National Technical University of Athens (<a href="https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en">ECE-NTUA</a>) in 2014 with the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng).
				I then received the Master of Sciences (MSc) degree in Systems and Control from the
				University of Twente (<a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/systems-control/">SC-UT</a>), The Netherlands, in 2016. In the meantime
				I worked at <a href="https://www.demcon.nl/en/">DEMCON</a> advanced
				mechatronics, Enschede, The Netherlands,
				supporting the development of medical devices.<br><br>
				In July 2021 I graduated from the University of Southampton (UoS), UK as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering and the Environment.
				My thesis titled "Development of 3D X-ray phase-contrast imaging and analysis tools for tubular and branching structures with applications in colorectal cancer research" focused on the morphological and topological quantification of budding crypts (tubular colonic glands that begin to branch during the early stages of colorectal cancer). The project gave birth to a set of methods for X-ray imaging, digital unrolling of the colon (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93184-x">method</a>, <a href="https://imagej.github.io/plugins/3d-cyclorama">software</a>), and 3D quantification of the budding structures.<br><br>
				Since January 2021 I joined <a href="https://www.radiidevices.com/">Radii devices</a>, a UoS spin-out that aims to revolutionise the way that prosthetic medical devices are designed. Currently working as the lead System Architect, I am resposible for the design of the Radii devices system for prosthetics and orthotics from the ground up.

					Harry was always the first to encounter any assignment, finishing early and <strong>helping his colleagues</strong> to proceed. During his teaching assistant job he was <strong>supervising students</strong> in tutorials, <strong>helping them</strong> to solve complicated dynamics problems and get a grip on the theory.
