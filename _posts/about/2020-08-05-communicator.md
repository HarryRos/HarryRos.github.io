begins with **careful listening** and concludes with a **good schematic**...

It is pivotal to avoid the common mistake of listening what you think they are trying to say rather that what your colleague is verbalizing. In fact, it is usually the case that people comprehend each concept in different ways, so being able to **communicate complex ideas** is a skill admittedly difficult to master.

Even in the **written form**, it takes practice and several rounds of feedback until a report becomes **clear and concise**. During the four years of my PhD, this has been common practice where I learned how to effectively get complicated ideas across to people from **different backgrounds**.

Admittedly, one of the best ways to do so is with a good schematic. As I tend to **think visually**, sketching a meaningful schematic is my go-to method...
