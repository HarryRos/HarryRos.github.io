is not simply being member of a team.

It is rather being able to function as a part of a greater whole, being able to **communicate effectively** in a technical but also emotional level.

Interpersonal skills become particularly important in stressful situations. This became apparent to me while fighting against wildfire as a member of a **volunteering** rescue unit (ETEA) in Grammaticos, Greece, 2014. Each member of the team became so invested in our task that they gradually veered off the pre-defined path risking to be cut-off from the team. Right there and then I learned how important is to communicate with the members of the team so that everyone is on the same page.

Offering a hand of help to those in need is compelling to me. I would never refuse to help a colleague even if I had urgent tasks of my own. And it is not a matter of reciprocal acts of kindness, no! Being **supportive** and **caring** firmly binds a team while the individual members feel the profound happiness of belonging.
