I call it **Perseverance!**

To me there is no choice but to finish what I started. Although, I am not sure yet whether this is a good or a bad virtue, it certainly contributes to achieving goals well-picked.

Truth is I do not enjoy uncertainty. Contrarily, I am quite efficient when I have a **well-defined goal** that I need to reach, even when the path leading there is not clear. Then I will inevitably get obsessed with doing what I set my mind on...<br>
It becomes like a **personal challenge** to me.

For instance, I set my mind to learn German during my undergraduate degree. I achieved that beside the admittedly demanding school I was attending, by painstakingly studying for two years to pass the B2 level in German. Another personal challenge, was that of moving from the electrical and computer engineering field **outside of my comfort zone** to a PhD in bio-engineering. I did so, not because I enjoy the field per se, but because it is the **impact** of my work that **matters to me**. In this case, being able to help in the study of colorectal cancer was the catalyst that pushed me towards that endeavor and kept me going till the end.

_No-matter the challenge, if it is **interesting** or with a **greater purpose**, I'm in for good._
