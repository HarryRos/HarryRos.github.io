In an ever-changing environment, such as that of an early university spin-out company, being **adaptive** is particularly important. I learned how to switch between roles within the team so that we can perform in harmony as a team and get the job done.

Having many different tasks and an increased workload as a member of a small team, being as **efficient** as possible is also necessary. As a team, we employ effective time-management via regular meetings, coordination through collaboration platforms (notion, gitlab, miro, etc.), and proper practices (Gantt-chart planning, task-based planning, etc.).

I started working at Radii Devices as an Algorithm Engineer, and subsequently the System Architect for 3D mesh morphing of prosthetic sockets. Over time, I proposed and introduced a range of new workflows / procedures, development tools (Google Bazel build framework / Test / benchmark, Doxygen), and best practices (unified nomenclature, improved communication) to ensure a high quality of engineering and design.

Progressing towards a senior role as the company's Technical Lead, I employ **management skills** to coordinate the team's development efforts. A part of my current role also includes **strategic and mid-term planning**, implementing the company's mid to long-term roadmap. Through hard work and commitment, we achieved major milestones, including winning an Innovate UK Bimedical Catalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/radii-devices_radii-devices-wins-funding-to-undertake-milestone-activity-6947464747629875200-go9A?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web">award</a> for multi-centre clinical trials, en route to certifying our software as a medical device.
