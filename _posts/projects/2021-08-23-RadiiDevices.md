In an ever-changing environment, such as that of an early university spin-out company, being **adaptive** is particularly important. I learned how to switch between roles within the team so that we can perform in harmony as a team and get the job done.

Having many different tasks and an increased workload as a member of a small team, being as **efficient** as possible is also necessary. As a team, we employ effective time-management via regular meetings, coordination through collaboration platforms (notion, gitlab, miro, etc.), and proper practices (Gantt-chart planning, task-based planning, etc.).

I started working at Radii Devices as an Algorithm Engineer for 3D mesh morphing of prosthetic sockets and **quickly took a leading role** as the company's system architect. Over time, I proposed and introduced a range of new workflows/procedures, development tools (Google Bazel build framework, Google Test, Google benchmark, Doxygen), and best practices (unified nomenclature, improved communication) to ensure a high quality of engineering and design.
