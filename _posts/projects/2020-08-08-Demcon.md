was an astounding experience for me. Demcon was at the time developing the <a href="https://www.demcon.nl/en/showcase/nano-core/">NanoCore</a>, a **miniaturised medical device** for non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring. It uses an inflatable finger cuff that measures the artery diameter, which is then used to estimate the blood pressure.

My work involved implementing an **_in silico_ physiological model** of the human finger to validate the performance of the _NanoCore_. I used measurements from human volunteers to estimate the parameters of my model using **multi-variable optimisation techniques**. I eventually deployed the model on an electronic **microcontroller platform** that was used to simulate human fingers with known physiology and test the resulting measurements of the _NanoCore_.

The **insights** gained from this project and the **improvements** I proposed eventually found their way in the design of the measuring device. Demcon has used the outcomes of my project to certify the device.

Working at <a href="https://www.demcon.nl/en/">Demcon</a> gave me a hands-on experience on **product development** and the routine of working at a high-tech company. I learned how to effectively **communicate and collaborate** with colleagues, and how to **support each other** when in need even if each one was working on a different project.
