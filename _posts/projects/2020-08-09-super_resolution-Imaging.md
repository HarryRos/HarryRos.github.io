is a **sensor-fusion** technique where multiple observations of the same ground truth are combined to reconstruct an image with higher resolution than the individual observations.

When it comes to X-ray imaging, technical constraints limit the spatial resolution that a detector can provide. In essence the detector's pixel size cannot go lower than a threshold value. Applying **super-resolution imaging** to this problem allows one to improve the spatial resolution of a given setup by recording the same signal multiple times.

Working at <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/muvis/about/about.page">Î¼-VIS</a> X-ray Imaging Centre, I developed a method to double the spatial resolution of a <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/muvis/about/equipment/hutch.page">Nikon X-tek micro-computed tomographic imager</a>.
