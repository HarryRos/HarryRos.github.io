When I was a child I used to break my toys apart to "figure how they work". This (bad?) habit has never left me.

It is this innate curiosity that led me to become an engineer. I just love to learn everything I cone about anything I can. I try not to be a know-it-all, but if you engage me in conversation I will definitely enjoy the discussion and hopefully you will too.

I was lucky enough to study at a technical university in Greece, where admittedly they focus on almost purely academic education with a very broad range of subjects. This fed my lust for learning, and I loved it, every single day of it. It was like nature laying its blueprints in front of my eyes and spelling every single detail out. When all of it made sense, and it eventually did, it was a delight!

Today, I tend to mix and match pieces of this wonderful puzzle to come up with unique solutions. Bringing together ideas from diverse disciplines allows you to approach a given problem from an unconventional angle which is often rewarding, particularly when the solution is not trivial.
