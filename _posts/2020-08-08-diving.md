<p>The serenity of the underwater world is so powerful that it washes away all uneasiness and trouble.</p>

<p>Learning scuba diving was one of my most vivid childhood dreams. So much, that I enrolled for the open-water course when I barely made the age limit. Now, over a decade later, I completed several courses in the row to become a NAUI rescue diver.</p>

<p>I believe that when you decide to do something, you have to do it at a certain standard. With scuba diving it is not enough to be confident in the water, you also have responsibility over your dive buddy and everyone else diving with you!</p>

<p>But what I enjoy the most is socializing before and after a dive. Even if you cannot communicate verbally underwater, scuba diving is truly a team sport. Great company makes it fun and great competence makes it safe.</p>
